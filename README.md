# apollo-link-segment

Auto analytics for apollo apps

## Installing / Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes.

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up & running.

```shell
npm install apollo-link-segment
```

### Prerequisites

- Apollo Link.

### Usage

By default the link assumes segment is ready for use at `window.analytics`.

```javascript
import apolloSegment from "apollo-link-segment";

ApolloLink.from([apolloSegment()]);
```

But you can pass a custom analytics instance to use

```javascript
const segmentInstance = require("analytics.js-loader")({
  writeKey: YOUR_SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY,
});

import apolloSegment from "apollo-link-segment";

ApolloLink.from([
  apolloSegment({
    analytics: segmentInstance,
  }),
]);
```

By default all operation types will be tracked by you can optionally provide a whitelist.

```javascript
import apolloSegment from "apollo-link-segment";

ApolloLink.from([
  apolloSegment({
    // only mutations will be tracked
    operationWhitelist: ["mutation"],
  }),
]);
```

By default the analytics.track will be called with the operation name as the event name and the operation as the event metadata.

For example the following query:

```
query GetUser {
  user {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

Will result in the following analytics.js call:

```
analytics.track('GetUser', <GraphqlOperationDetails>)
```
